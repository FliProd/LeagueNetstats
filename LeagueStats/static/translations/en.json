  "terms.title": "Terms of Participation",
  "terms.study": "You are invited to participate in an academic research study on understanding the effects of different network conditions on the performance of players in online videogames. The study will be implemented as a web service that will allow you to upload network logs generated by the League of Legends client during both League of Legends or Teamfight Tactics matches. The study does not require you to download any kind of software, nor does it modify your client in any way or form. \n\nThe purpose of the Study is to figure out: (1) what are the conditions under which users play, (2) how these different network conditions affect players’ performance. When you upload one or more logs, the platform will automatically get the in-game events from the official Riot API (including: gold, experience, champion kills, neutral objective kills, buildings destruction, etc.), and correlate historical information of your previous matches to tell you if certain event is statistically likely to be related to some network event. The data obtained by the Study will be used to give further insights to research into latency and loss mitigation techniques in videogame design, allowing the creation of new techniques that minimize the effects of the network on your matches. You will not receive a survey or be required to answer any kind of questions as part of the Study. \n\nThe Study will be limited to players of League of Legends or Teamfight Tactics who are 18 or above (each a “Study Participant”).  \n\nParticipant’s Involvement: You are free to use the platform as you see fit, but we warn you that the quality of the results is likely to improve the more data about your network conditions we have. The time you will need to invest in the platform depends on how often you choose to use it and how much information you want to be shown; using the default settings, each session should last no longer than 5 minutes. We reserve the right to terminate your participation if you violate these Terms of Participation or any applicable laws or policies.  \n\nNo Compensation and Voluntary Participation Only. You will not receive any compensation for your participation in the Study besides those services offered by the platform, and we cannot and do not guarantee that you will receive any benefits from this Study. ",
  "terms.privacy": "All data collection and processing shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) guidelines outlined in the following paragraphs. If you disagree, DO NOT USE the Platform or any of its associated services. \n\nData Collection: From your participation in the Study we will collect your Riot account name and region, your geographical location, the network logs you upload to the platform, and in-game information publicly published by Riot. You may decide to not share specific data, however, this may lead to limited service functionality. We also reserve the right to draw connections between your matches and other users of the platform, if you sign in to this functionality. You are free to sign out of at any moment.
